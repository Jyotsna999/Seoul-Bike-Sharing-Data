# Seoul-Bike-Sharing-Data

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. The goal is to help commuting in the cosmopolitan cities and reduce the pollution amounts caused by cars, individual motorcycles etc. and create green cities altogether. It also is a healthiest way for travelling to work or school. It is important to make rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time lessening the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern as it can be used as alternative to the commuters in cities. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

In this repository, I have worked on developing supervised Machine Learning models like Linear regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines with Linear, RBF, Polynomial, Sigmoid kernels, Decision Trees, Neural Networks with ADAM optimizer, Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer, RMS Prop optimizers. These models were optimized by GridSearchCV, Stratified K-fold cross validation.Also implemented Unsupervised Machine Learning models K-Means, Expectation Maximization and compared the silhouette scores.
